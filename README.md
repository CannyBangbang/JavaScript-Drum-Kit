# JavaScript Drum Kit
Project completed for the 30 day vanilla JS coding challenge. Allows for drum sound effects to play when hitting keys on the home row.

## Getting Started
I have only had success with the audio playing in Firefox, so it is the recommend choice if launching from a browser. The .wav files would not play sound on IE or Chrome and all other browsers are untested.
